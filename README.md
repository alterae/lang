# lang

An attempt to build a programming language, as a learning exercise and for fun.

## design goals

The goal is to make a simple proof-of concept programming language interpreter, implemented in Rust.
The language will be expression-oriented, functional, and perhaps actually usable at some point (if I ever finish it).
